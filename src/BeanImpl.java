/**
 * Code by @author Wonsun Ahn
 * 
 * <p>
 * Bean: Each bean is assigned a skill level from 0-9 on creation according to a
 * normal distribution with average SKILL_AVERAGE and standard deviation
 * SKILL_STDEV. The formula to calculate the skill level is:
 * 
 * <p>
 * SKILL_AVERAGE = (double) SLOT_COUNT * 0.5
 * SKILL_STDEV = (double) Math.sqrt(SLOT_COUNT * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5))
 * SKILL_LEVEL = (int) Math.round(rand.nextGaussian() * SKILL_STDEV + SKILL_AVERAGE)
 * 
 * <p>
 * A skill level of 9 means it always makes the "right" choices (pun intended)
 * when the machine is operating in skill mode ("skill" passed on command line).
 * That means the bean will always go right when a peg is encountered, resulting
 * it falling into slot 9. A skill evel of 0 means that the bean will always go
 * left, resulting it falling into slot 0. For the in-between skill levels, the
 * bean will first go right then left. For example, for a skill level of 7, the
 * bean will go right 7 times then go left twice.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Skill levels are irrelevant when the machine operates in luck mode. In that
 * case, the bean will have a 50/50 chance of going right or left, regardless of
 * skill level. The formula to calculate the direction is: rand.nextInt(2). If
 * the return value is 0, the bean goes left. If the return value is 1, the bean
 * goes right.
